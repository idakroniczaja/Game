    <h1>Welcome to the “Chubby bird”!</h1>
  <p> <img src='./game New/images/donuts/green_icing_green_sprinkles.png'>In order to win the game, you have to score 30 points by eating  doughnuts falling from sky, while avoiding bad monsters coming your way. Don't let any doughnut fall on the ground, you'll lose your points!  If you stumble upon one of the monsters, you lose one of 3 lives. The game is over when you lose all 3 lives. </p>
 <p><img src='./game New/images/donuts/orange_icing_chocolate_shaving.png'>Sounds easy, right? That's where you'r wrong, my friend! You know you can't get away with eating doughnuts and stay slim!</p>
<p><img src='./game New/images/donuts/chocolate_icing_chocolate_drizzle.png'>So, be careful, because with each doughtnut you eat, you put some weight on and become bigger and bigger, what makes avoiding enemies harder and harder.</p>
